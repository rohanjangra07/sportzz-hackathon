⚽ SportSense — Injury Risk Prediction System
🧠 Overview
SportSense is a predictive analytics system that uses machine learning to forecast the likelihood of player injuries based on workload, fitness, and performance data. It empowers coaches and sports analysts to optimize training intensity, rest schedules, and reduce injury risks.

🎯 Project Objective
Predict whether an athlete is at high or low injury risk using physiological and performance metrics, and visualize key factors influencing injuries.

🧩 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
IDE/Notebook: Jupyter Notebook
Dataset: Kaggle — Sports Injury Dataset (or your uploaded dataset)
🏗️ Features
✅ Preprocessing of physiological and training data ✅ Binary classification (Injured vs. Healthy) ✅ Machine Learning models — Random Forest & XGBoost ✅ Visual risk factor analysis (Heatmaps, Bar Charts, ROC Curves) ✅ Injury prediction for a new player input ✅ Extendable for Streamlit web deployment

📊 Visual Outputs
Visualization	Description
🔥 Heatmap	Correlation among player attributes
📈 ROC Curve	Model performance visualization
🧩 Feature Importance	Most influential injury factors
🧠 Example Prediction
new_player = {
  "training_load": 75,
  "match_minutes": 90,
  "sleep_hours": 7.5,
  "previous_injury": 1,
  "heart_rate": 85,
  "fatigue_score": 60
}
Output:

Risk Level: 🔴 High  
Risk Probability: 0.81
🚀 Future Improvements
Integrate with Streamlit dashboard for real-time inputs
Add rest duration recommendation engine
Use deep learning models (LSTM) for time-series workload data
Deploy via Flask / FastAPI backend
